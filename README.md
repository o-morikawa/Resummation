# Abstract
This repository provides comparison between many resummation techniques based on perturbation theory:
- Truncation of perturbation series
- Borel resummation
- Pade approximation
- Borel-Pada resummation
- Optimized perturbation theory
- Oder dependent mapping
and so on.

# Mathematica nootbook
borel-instanton.pdf, a LaTeX pdf, provides a simple example of Borel resummation analytically.

Some Mathematica files are given as ".nb" and/or ".pdf".
Most parts are devoted to an explanation of Marino's book, "Instantons and Large N".
E.g., see pade.nb (pade.pdf).

Moreover, we address other resummation techniques such as oder dependent mapping (see odm.nb/odm.pdf).
